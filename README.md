# Identifying Profitable Customer Segments Using Transaction and Demographic Data

This project explores how a retail store can leverage its transaction data and customer demographics to identify profitable customer segments, based on a SQL case study.

## Business Context

A retail store aims to better understand its customer behavior using point-of-sale (POS) data. A key business objective is to identify which groups of customers are most valuable or profitable.

## Data Availability

The analysis uses three primary datasets:

*   **Customer:** Contains customer demographic information (e.g., gender, age, city).
*   **Transactions:** Details customer transactions, including sales amount, quantity, product details, and transaction date.
*   **Product category:** Provides hierarchical information about products, linking subcategories to main categories.

The relationship between these tables allows for linking customer attributes to their specific purchasing behaviors and the revenue they generate.

## Approach: Linking Data to Identify Profitability

By joining data from the `Customer`, `Transactions`, and `Product category` tables, the store can perform analyses that connect customer characteristics to their value. The case study outlines several types of analyses that directly contribute to identifying profitable segments:

1.  **Analyzing Revenue by Demographics:** Calculate the total revenue generated by different demographic groups, such as specific age ranges or genders. For example, determining the **total revenue generated from "Male" customers in the "Electronics" category** or the **net total revenue generated by consumers aged between 25 to 35 years**. High revenue contribution from a demographic group indicates potential profitability.
2.  **Identifying High-Value Behaviors:** Analyze transaction patterns to identify customers who exhibit behaviors associated with higher value, such as high transaction frequency. The case study asks to identify **how many customers have >10 transactions**, excluding returns. Customers who transact more often are often more engaged and potentially more profitable.
3.  **Examining Purchasing Patterns and Revenue within Segments:** Deep dive into what specific demographic or behavior-based segments are buying and how much value those purchases represent. This includes looking at **total revenue by product sub-category for male customers in the Electronics category** or analyzing **average and total revenue by each subcategory for the categories which are among top 5 in terms of quantity sold**.
4.  **Understanding Revenue Generation by Product/Location and Linking to Segments:** Analyze revenue performance by product category or store type. While not directly demographic segmentation, understanding where high revenue is generated (e.g., **net total revenue generated in categories Electronics and Books**, **combined revenue earned from “Electronics” & “Clothing” categories, from “Flagship stores”**, or identifying which **store-type sells the maximum products; by value of sales amount**) can help identify associated customer segments.
5.  **Analyzing Returns Impacting Profitability:** Assess the impact of returns on profitability for different products or potentially for specific customer groups. Analyzing the **percentage of sales and returns by product sub category** or identifying which **product category has seen the max value of returns** can highlight areas or customer segments with lower net profitability due to high return rates.
6.  **Identifying High-Performing Categories and Associated Customers:** Determine which product categories contribute most significantly to average revenue. By identifying **categories for which average revenue is above the overall average**, the characteristics of the customers who are the primary purchasers in these profitable categories can then be analyzed to define valuable segments.

## Conclusion

By executing analyses that link customer demographics (from the `Customer` table) with their purchasing behaviors and the revenue they generate (from the `Transactions` and `Product category` tables), a retail store can effectively **identify specific groups of customers that contribute most significantly to overall sales and net revenue**, thereby defining and targeting profitable customer segments.

## Case Study Notes

The case study involves writing SQL queries with specific constraints, such as read-only access and needing to handle date format conversions as an initial step.
